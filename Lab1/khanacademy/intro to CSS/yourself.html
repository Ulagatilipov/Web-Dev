<h2>
    History beach
</h2>

<p>
    This summer, millions of Americans will flock to the beach, taking advantage of long days, warm weather and the end of classes. From Coney Island and Venice Beach to the shores of Lake Michigan and the Gulf Coast, bags will be packed, coolers dragged, sunscreen slathered, and sandcastles built. Similar scenes will be repeated around the world. In Rio de Janeiro, Sydney, Barcelona, and Beirut, children will be splashing in the waves while sunbathers doze on the sand. A day at the beach is a cultural ritual.

<h3><strong class="Beach-poem">Beach-poem</strong></h3>

<p>
    Waves come crashing to grey sullen shores.<br>
    Powerful and strong, it breathes and roars.<br>
    Cascading and caressing each grain of sand,<br>
    A warm embrace between sea and land.
